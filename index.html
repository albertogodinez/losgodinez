                    <p>Her side: I am a control freak when it comes to planning our trips,
                    so when Alberto said he was planning a nice dinner for one night in Santorini,
                    Greece I immediately asked what restaurant and what do I need to wear. He played
                    it off so smooth even with the million and one questions. Fast forward to the day
                    of, Alberto had disappeared and left me in the lobby of the hotel/restaurant. For
                    some reason, I started to get butterflies as the woman told me to follow her
                    through the caved doorways, but then I saw flower petals on the ground and
                    wondered who they were for.
                    </p>

                    <p>She proceeded to walk me to the staircase and I
                    slowly made my way down trying to keep it cool, but that’s when I saw him,
                    standing there (handsome as ever-I may add) in this beautiful scenic spot. Me,
                    being the awkward person I am, tried to make a joke that he wasn’t there to walk me
                    down the stairs in these heels, he sheepishly laughed and said “it’s cause I was right
                    here baby”. Then I lost it, I cried the entire time, even as I told myself that there
                    is a photographer and to play it cool and just smile. I could not hold back the tears
                    of joy, as I knew without a doubt that I wanted to spend the rest of my life
                    with this man. We spent the rest of the night eating dinner and just talking
                    about our future, our goals, and the wedding.
                    </p>

                    <p>I cannot wait to marry this man
                    and have the wedding of our dreams.

                    sometimes almost too much lol. I will never be able to just say what my favorite memory is with her,
                    but some of my favorite memories were just laying on the beds and just talking for hours. We’ve been there for all

                    since middle school and since then have had countless Super Smash tournaments,
                    Gears of War matches, drunken nights, sneaker conventions, freestyle sessions,

                    and just driving around listening to Action Bronson. It's such a cool feeling

                      Ya know, I did not really need an extra sister (I already have 4 + 1 step sister),
                      but I’m honestly blessed to consider Laura a little sister. I have
                      seen her grow up from this little violinist in middle
                      school to a woman taking on challenges like no other. She has fought
                      through adversity to make her family and me proud, and be the strong
                      independent woman she is today. Not many 20 year olds can take on a
                      completely new state for an internship, but you did. If I do not tell you
                      enough, I’m beyond proud of you Laura and I’m proud to call you my sister-in-law.
                      I cannot wait to see all the adventures life takes you on. P.S. thanks for
                      taking me to meet Casey ;)
