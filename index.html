                <h3>2016</h3>
                <p>Her side: I am a control freak when it comes to planning our trips, 
                  so when Alberto said he was planning a nice dinner for one night in Santorini, 
                  Greece I immediately asked what restaurant and what do I need to wear. He played 
                  it off so smooth even with the million and one questions. Fast forward to the day 
                  of, Alberto had disappeared and left me in the lobby of the hotel/restaurant. For 
                  some reason, I started to get butterflies as the woman told me to follow her 
                  through the caved doorways, but then I saw flower petals on the ground and 
                  wondered who they were for. She proceeded to walk me to the staircase and I 
                  slowly made my way down trying to keep it cool, but that’s when I saw him, 
                  standing there (handsome as ever-I may add) in this beautiful scenic spot. Me, 
                  being the awkward person I am, tried to make a joke that he wasn’t there to walk me 
                  down the stairs in these heels, he sheepishly laughed and said “it’s cause I was right 
                  here baby”. Then I lost it, I cried the entire time, even as I told myself that there 
                  is a photographer and to play it cool and just smile. I could not hold back the tears 
                  of joy, as I knew without a doubt that I wanted to spend the rest of my life 
                  with this man. We spent the rest of the night eating dinner and just talking 
                  about our future, our goals, and the wedding. I cannot wait to marry this man 
                  and have the wedding of our dreams. </p>

                but some of my favorite memories were just laying on the beds and just talking for hours. We’ve been there for all

                them as backups. Haha. On a serious note, Jazzmine is definitely 
                the sweetest of all of my siblings, she has the kindest heart and 
                is always there for all of us. I’m so happy that you are Noah’s 
                mommy, you were always the mommy of the group and I know you will 
                raise Noah right. I cannot wait for our future children to grow up 
                together and have the most amazing relationships. </p>
