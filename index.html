                <p>Judie and Z. met in the fall of 2007 when Z. was hired at Digitaria as a project manager. Judie had just started a few weeks prior as the new receptionist. It would be nice to say that it was love at first sight, however, they unfortunately did not hit it off right away. If you asked Z., he would probably say that she had just never met anyone like him before. If you asked Judie she would probably say that she initially was just not that impressed.
